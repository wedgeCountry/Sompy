This piece of code implements the SOM Algrorithm (Self Organizing Maps Algorithm) using numpy.

Built against the Python 2.7 on Linux.  Python 3 compatibility unknown.  
No OS specific code used, but untested on other OSes.
Dependencies:
  python-numpy
  Saving images (like the similarity mask) requires Python Imaging Library (PIL)

sompy.py contains the SOM class
somtest.py contains an example which creates the SOM for 8 base colors.

Normally you would just view the similarity mask. Which gives you an idea of the smoothness.
The darker an area is the more rapid the change that occurred there across the SOM. 
By applying SOM.removeBmuNodes(threshold) one can remove interpolating nodes. This can be useful for clustering.
